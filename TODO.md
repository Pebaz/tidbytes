# TODO

> What would it take to consider this project done?

- 🔰 Serialization to idiomatic primitive types
- 🔰 Expose fundamental natural operations as methods on `Mem`
- 🔰 Assign by index
- 🔰 Negative indexes
- 🔰 Test all methods from `Mem`
- 🔰 Test all methods from `Num`
- 🔰 Rename "Von Neumann" to "Natural"
- 🔰 Blog post
- 🔰 Remove iterations after blog post
- 🔰 Write readme
- 🔰 Go through each codec and note it in readme (from tuple is interesting)

# Aspirational Goals

- ⭐ Parametrize test suite
- ⭐ C++ implementation
- ⭐ Rust implementation
- ⭐ Refactor Python implementation to use bindings to C++ implementation for speed
